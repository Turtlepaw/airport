Hey buddy :) 

You're going to undertake some complex changes. It might be a little overwhelming.
If a task you're given feels very big, complex or could have multiple different
approaches, lay out your plan and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

Make sure you remember to use globalThis instead of window.

And most importantly, have fun!

Your friend,
